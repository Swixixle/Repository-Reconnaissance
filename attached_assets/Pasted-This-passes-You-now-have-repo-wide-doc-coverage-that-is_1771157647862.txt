This passes. You now have **repo-wide doc coverage** that is internally consistent *and* matches code:

* Files exist with fresh timestamps: `README.md`, `replit.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
* CI Feed microcopy updated in `client/src/pages/ci-feed.tsx` (static-only line present).
* Env vars documented match actual usage in `server/routes.ts`, `server/ci-worker.ts`, and analyzer (`GITHUB_TOKEN`), plus `CI_TMP_DIR` + `ANALYZER_TIMEOUT_MS`.
* Endpoint lists in **all docs** match exactly what’s registered in `server/routes.ts`.

Two concrete fixes / cleanups I recommend before you ship:

## 1) Remove the duplicate `API.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` at repo root (or make them stubs)

Your `ls` output shows both:

* `docs/API.md` and also `API.md`
* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and also `ARCHITECTURE.md`

That will confuse users and future you.

**Pick one canonical location.** I’d keep `docs/*` as canonical and make root files either:

* deleted, or
* tiny stubs that link to `docs/*`.

**Option A (delete root duplicates):**

```bash
rm -f API.md ARCHITECTURE.md
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: remove duplicate root API/ARCHITECTURE docs"
```

**Option B (keep root as pointers):**
Replace `API.md` content with:

```md
# API

Canonical API documentation: `docs/API.md`
```

Replace `ARCHITECTURE.md` content with:

```md
# Architecture

Canonical architecture documentation: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
```

Then:

```bash
git add API.md ARCHITECTURE.md
git commit -m "docs: make root API/ARCHITECTURE pointers to docs/"
```

## 2) Verify what changed in those “4 commits” (sanity)

Right now you didn’t show `git show --stat -1`, so we can’t see what’s in the latest commit(s). Do:

```bash
git log --oneline -5
git show --stat -1
```

This is just to confirm the last commit truly is documentation-only and not unexpected code edits.

# Ship it

You’re ahead of origin by 4 commits. Push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

If you do the “duplicate docs” cleanup, run this final check after:

```bash
rg -n "docs/API.md|docs/ARCHITECTURE.md|API.md|ARCHITECTURE.md" README.md replit.md
```

and make sure references point to exactly the canonical files you chose.
