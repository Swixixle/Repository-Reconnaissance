Do these **three** things, in this order.

---

## 1) Exit the “try” install prompt

You’re sitting at:

> Would you like to run try from Nix and add it to your project? [Yn]:

Type:

```bash
n
```

and press Enter.

That prompt exists only because bash mistook your pasted TypeScript for a command.

---

## 2) Make a real “operate missing ⇒ null” fix (optional but recommended)

This prevents storing `{}` when `operate.json` isn’t present.

Open `server/routes.ts` and change **only** the `operate` read:

### Find this line:

```ts
const operate = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(operatePath, "utf-8").catch(() => "{}"));
```

### Replace with:

```ts
let operate: any = null;
try {
  operate = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(operatePath, "utf-8"));
} catch {
  operate = null;
}
```

Leave everything else alone.

Then restart your server (whatever your usual `npm run dev` / Replit run does).

---

## 3) Verify the dashboard is actually reading operate

You already proved the API returns it. Now prove UI consumption:

### A) Re-run analysis (fresh)

Use the UI “Analyze” button on any project (or create “Replit: workspace” again).

### B) Confirm via API (fast)

Replace `15` with the newest replit project id if it changes:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import json, urllib.request
pid = 15
a = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(f"http://localhost:5000/api/projects/{pid}/analysis"))
op = a.get("operate") or {}
print("has_operate:", bool(op))
print("readiness_keys:", list((op.get("readiness") or {}).keys()))
print("gaps:", [(g.get("title"), g.get("severity")) for g in (op.get("gaps") or [])])
PY
```

If that prints readiness keys + gaps, backend is correct.

### C) If the UI still shows “No operational data”

Then it’s purely a frontend mapping issue. Next command to locate the UI usage:

```bash
grep -R "operate" -n client/src | head -n 80
```

…and we patch the component that’s still looking at `howto` / old field names.

---

If you do only one thing right now: **step 1 (type `n`)** so you’re not stuck. Then tell me what your UI shows on the Operator Dashboard after a fresh analysis.
