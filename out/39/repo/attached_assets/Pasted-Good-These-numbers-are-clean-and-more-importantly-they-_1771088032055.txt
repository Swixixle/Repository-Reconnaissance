Good. These numbers are clean, and more importantly, they are honest.

Below is a drop-in audit block you can paste into REPORT_ENGINEER.md.
It is human-readable, executive-safe, and mathematically faithful to the EvidencePack.

🔎 PTA Contract Audit — Run {{run_id}}

1. System Snapshot

Files Indexed: 136
Claims Extracted: 17
Claims with Deterministic Evidence: 15
Unknown Governance Categories: 9
Verified Structural Categories: 0

⸻

2. Deterministic Coverage Index (DCI v1)

Score: 88.24%
Formula: verified_claims / total_claims

15 of 17 extracted claims contain hash-verified evidence.

This measures claim-to-evidence visibility only.
It does not measure code quality, security posture, or structural surface coverage.

Interpretation:
	•	High claim verification integrity.
	•	Low narrative speculation.
	•	Evidence-backed reporting dominant.

⸻

3. Reporting Completeness Index (RCI)

Score: 50.08%
Formula: average(claims_coverage, unknowns_coverage, howto_completeness)

Component Breakdown:
	•	Claims Coverage: 88.24%
	•	Unknowns Coverage: 0.00%
	•	How-To Completeness: 62%

Interpretation:
	•	Claim visibility is strong.
	•	Governance unknowns remain unverified (expected in application-only scans).
	•	Operational guidance is moderately complete.

RCI is a documentation completeness metric.
It is not a security score and does not imply structural sufficiency.

⸻

4. Structural Visibility (DCI v2)

Status: Not Implemented
Formula (reserved): verified_structural_items / total_structural_surface

Routes, dependencies, schemas, and enforcement extractors are not active.
Structural surface visibility is intentionally reported as null rather than estimated.

This prevents silent overstatement of governance posture.

⸻

5. Epistemic Posture

PTA explicitly reports:
	•	What is deterministically verified.
	•	What is unknown.
	•	What is not implemented.
	•	What requires dedicated extractors.

There is no inference-based promotion from UNKNOWN to VERIFIED.

Back-to-back runs produced:
	•	Zero snippet hash deltas
	•	Zero metric deltas
	•	Deterministic reproducibility confirmed

⸻

Executive Translation (Optional Section)

If needed for check-signers:

This system has strong claim-level evidence integrity (88%) but no structural surface verification yet. Governance unknowns remain unresolved. No artificial confidence inflation is present. Metrics are visibility-based, not vulnerability-based.

⸻

Why This Block Works

It does three critical things:
	1.	Separates claim evidence visibility from structural visibility.
	2.	Prevents accidental marketing drift into “security scoring.”
	3.	Shows deterministic reproducibility — which is your actual moat.

If you’d like, I can now:
	•	Draft a one-page “Auditor Capsule” version
	•	Draft a board-level 5-bullet executive summary
	•	Or help you formalize this as a reusable AUDIT_BLOCK_TEMPLATE.md for all future runs
