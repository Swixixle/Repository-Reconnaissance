You’re still not past the gate, because you still did not paste the artifacts. You described them, but there are no actual:
	•	git diff --stat output
	•	git diff pta/unknowns.py output
	•	EvidencePack key dump / JSON excerpt
	•	VERIFIED-count one-liner output
	•	head -n 120 DIFF_REPORT.md output

in the chat.

So I cannot validate anything. Summaries don’t count.

Also, you’re now claiming dependencies are empty under verified_structural. That’s fine if your lockfile parser isn’t wired yet — but earlier you said dependencies had 6 items. This kind of flip-flop is exactly why artifacts are required.

Do this exactly (and only this)

Send the Replit agent this instruction and require their next reply to include only raw command output blocks—no prose.

Required commands (copy/paste and run)

# 1) Diffs (show raw output)
git diff --stat

git diff pta/unknowns.py
git diff pta/adapter.py

# If these files are elsewhere, run:
# git ls-files | grep -E "unknowns|adapter|render|diff|cli|verify_policy"

# 2) EvidencePack excerpt (raw)
python -c "import json; d=json.load(open('outA/evidence_pack.v1.json')); print('TOP_KEYS=', list(d.keys())); print(json.dumps({k:d.get(k) for k in ['evidence_pack_version','verified','verified_structural','unknowns','metrics']}, indent=2)[:2500])"

# 3) VERIFIED proof in --no-llm (raw)
python -c "import json; c=json.load(open('outA/claims.json')); items=c.get('claims', c) if isinstance(c, dict) else c; \
def ok(x): \
 e=x.get('evidence', []) if isinstance(x, dict) else []; \
 return any(isinstance(i, dict) and i.get('snippet_hash_verified') is True for i in e); \
print('verified_claims=', sum(1 for x in items if isinstance(x, dict) and ok(x)))"

# 4) Diff excerpt (raw)
head -n 120 out_diff/DIFF_REPORT.md

No explanation text. Only the outputs.

Acceptance criteria (what I’ll check once outputs appear)
	1.	unknowns.py:
	•	No claim-driven upgrade logic
	•	Any upgrade is artifact-driven with snippet-hash re-read verification
	2.	adapter.py:
	•	verified_structural either:
	•	populated solely from deterministic structural outputs (routes inventory, lockfiles, schema outputs), or
	•	explicitly empty with _notes: not_implemented
	3.	EvidencePack excerpt:
	•	dci_v1_claim_visibility present and clarifies it’s claim visibility
	•	rci_reporting_completeness present
	•	dci_v2_structural_visibility either not_implemented or numeric
	•	unknowns present and stable
	4.	Diff excerpt:
	•	Deterministic deltas only
	•	No “risk/secure/vulnerability” language

Once the outputs are actually visible here, I’ll give you the final “Wave 1 Accepted” sign-off and the exact release tag + release notes to publish.
