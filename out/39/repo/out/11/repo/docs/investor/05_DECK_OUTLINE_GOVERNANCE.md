# Nikodemus Systems Investor Deck Outline
## 10 Slides — AI Governance / Institutional Risk Lane

---

### Slide 1: Title
**Nikodemus Systems: Governance Infrastructure for AI Risk**
- Subtitle: Bounded inference. Explicit limits. Auditable provenance.
- Tagline: "Not another AI model. The layer that governs them."

---

### Slide 2: The Problem — Model Opacity in Institutional Settings
- AI systems are deployed without audit trails
- Black-box outputs cannot be explained or reconstructed
- No provenance linking conclusions to source evidence
- No refusal behavior — models output regardless of confidence
- Institutions cannot answer: "How did this system reach this conclusion?"
- *Intent: Establish that AI governance is a missing layer, not a feature gap*

---

### Slide 3: The Cost of Ungoverned AI
- Regulatory exposure from unexplainable decisions
- Legal liability from indefensible AI-assisted conclusions
- Board-level risk from undocumented AI behavior
- Insurance exposure from unauditable AI systems
- Reputational damage from AI failures that cannot be traced
- *Intent: Make governance failure financially and legally concrete*

---

### Slide 4: Regulatory Direction
- EU AI Act: Moving toward explainability and auditability for high-risk systems
- SEC proposed rules: Trending toward documentation of AI-assisted reasoning
- NIST AI RMF: Emphasizes traceability, reproducibility, contestability
- Insurance and legal trends: Increasing liability exposure for unexplainable AI
- *Intent: Show governance is an emerging requirement, not optional*

---

### Slide 5: Nikodemus System Overview
- Governance infrastructure, not an AI model
- Sits above LLMs — does not compete, does not replace
- Four capabilities: Extract, Curate, Analyze, Report
- Core enforcements: provenance, sufficiency gates, refusal logic, fingerprinting
- *Intent: Position as infrastructure layer, not another AI tool*

---

### Slide 6: What Nikodemus Does — And Does Not Do
**Does:**
- Extract structured data with source provenance
- Link claims explicitly to evidence
- Design analysis to gate on evidence sufficiency
- Document conditions where evidence is insufficient
- Produce fingerprinted reports for integrity verification

**Does Not:**
- Generate outputs without evidence
- Auto-infer relationships without explicit linkage
- Operate as an autonomous decision system
- Claim certainty where none exists

- *Intent: Build trust through explicit limits; differentiate from "capable AI" positioning*

---

### Slide 7: Architecture — Bounded Heuristics and Explicit Limits
- **Bounded heuristics**: Analysis designed to gate on evidence density thresholds
- **Explicit limits**: System documents what it will not conclude
- **Configured for repeatability**: Designed for consistent output from consistent input
- **Report fingerprinting**: SHA-256 hashes for post-hoc verification
- **Human-in-the-loop design**: System supports analyst judgment, does not replace it
- *Intent: Show technical architecture designed for governance*

---

### Slide 8: Where Nikodemus Sits Relative to LLMs
| Layer | Function | Nikodemus Role |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Data Layer | Raw documents, sources | Input to extraction |
| Model Layer | LLMs, embeddings, inference | Not competing here |
| **Governance Layer** | Provenance, limits, audit | **Nikodemus operates here** |
| Application Layer | User-facing tools | Consumes governed outputs |

- Nikodemus is the governance substrate between raw AI capability and institutional use
- *Intent: Clarify strategic position — not a model competitor*

---

### Slide 9: Business Model
- Deployment: Local-first client with optional enterprise on-premise installation
- Pricing: Per-seat licensing (analyst/governance officer workstation model)
- Expansion: Add-on modules for specific verticals (AI oversight, risk, compliance)
- Services: Implementation, governance framework alignment, audit preparation
- *Intent: Show enterprise-ready model with clear revenue path*

---

### Slide 10: Go-to-Market
**Phase 1:** Direct engagement with AI governance and risk functions
- Pain is acute, budget is emerging, regulatory pressure is real

**Phase 2:** Expand to board-level risk oversight and insurer AI underwriting
- Fiduciary duty angle creates executive-level demand

**Phase 3:** Platform for AI governance certification and third-party audit
- Become the evidence standard for AI auditability

**Why This Team:**
- [Insert team background: governance expertise, technical capability, regulatory experience]
- Built by practitioners who understand that AI without governance is liability

- *Intent: Show credible path from first customer to category leadership*
