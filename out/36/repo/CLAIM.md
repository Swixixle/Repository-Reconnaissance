# ELI Claim — v0.1

A claim is a structured assertion supported by external evidence.

## Required Fields

- Statement: human-readable assertion
- Evidence: links to signed artifacts (receipts, hashes)
- Inference Level: proven | derived | heuristic
- Scope: explicit limits of the claim
- Issuer: who is making the claim (optional but explicit)

## Non-Goals

- Claims do not self-verify
- Claims are not cryptographic objects
- Claims do not imply truth beyond their evidence

ELI exists to separate proof from inference.
