# Lantern: Evidentiary Record System for Institutional Risk

## The Problem

Organizations managing compliance, legal, and investigative workflows face a fundamental breakdown: **evidence is scattered, claims are untraced, and analysis is not auditable**.

Current tools force a choice between:
- **Speed** (AI summaries, keyword search) — fast but legally indefensible
- **Rigor** (manual review, paralegal labor) — defensible but unscalable

When regulators, auditors, or opposing counsel ask "how did you reach this conclusion?", most organizations cannot answer. They have findings without provenance, conclusions without evidence chains, and reports without integrity verification.

This gap costs real money:
- Compliance failures from missed connections
- Legal exposure from undocumented reasoning
- Audit findings from untraceable assertions

## Why Current Tools Fail

1. **Document management systems** store files but don't extract structure
2. **AI summarization tools** produce conclusions but erase provenance
3. **Investigation platforms** optimize for speed, not defensibility
4. **Manual review** doesn't scale and can't be audited after the fact

The market has optimized for "insights" when what institutions need is **evidence records**.

## Lantern's Differentiator

Lantern is an **evidentiary record system**, not an insight engine.

Core design principles:
- **No offset, no item**: Every extracted entity traces to exact source positions
- **Deterministic by design**: Configured to produce consistent, repeatable output
- **Report fingerprinting**: SHA-256 hashes for post-hoc integrity verification
- **Explicit limits**: The system states what it cannot conclude, not just what it can

Lantern produces:
- Structured data extraction with full provenance
- Curated dossiers with entities, claims, and evidence linkage
- Heuristic analysis that gates on evidence sufficiency
- Publication-ready reports with audit trails

## Who Buys

**Primary buyers** (payor + legal/compliance lane):
- Healthcare payors managing fraud investigation and audit defense
- Legal/compliance teams requiring defensible evidence chains
- Institutional risk functions needing auditable analysis
- Government affairs teams tracking regulatory and enforcement actions

**Common pain points**:
- "We can't show our work to auditors"
- "Our AI tools produce conclusions we can't defend"
- "We need to trace every claim to source documents"

## Why Now

1. **Regulatory pressure increasing**: SOX, HIPAA, emerging AI governance rules demand auditability
2. **AI backlash in legal contexts**: Courts and regulators rejecting AI-generated analysis without provenance
3. **Cost of ambiguity rising**: Settlement costs, audit penalties, and reputational damage from indefensible claims
4. **No incumbent solution**: Enterprise tools optimize for throughput, not defensibility

The market is moving from "what did you find?" to "how can you prove it?"

Lantern is purpose-built for that question.
