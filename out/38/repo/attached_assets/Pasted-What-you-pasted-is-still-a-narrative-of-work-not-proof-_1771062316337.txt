What you pasted is **still a narrative of work**, not proof. The key risk here is the same as before: *agents claiming completion without showing artifacts*.

So here’s what we do **right now**:

1. I’m going to treat their message as **unverified**.
2. I’m going to give you a **single pasteable demand** to the agents that forces them to output the exact proof items.
3. I’m also going to call out a couple of **logic errors** in what they claimed (so you don’t ship drift).

## Two red flags in the agent’s write-up

### Red flag 1: “Typer single-command mode doesn’t create a subcommand”

That’s **not reliably true** as stated. Typer can be structured either way:

* `Typer(add_completion=False)` with multiple `@app.command()` -> subcommands exist
* Single-command apps usually work fine as `python file.py --help` and `python file.py <args>`

If your intended contract is **explicitly**:

```bash
python analyzer_cli.py analyze --replit
```

then the CLI must be a multi-command Typer app (or handle `analyze` as an argument manually). Otherwise you get mismatch.

**Conclusion:** don’t “fix server routes” to match a broken CLI. Fix CLI to match the contract.

### Red flag 2: “Server routes / frontend / web UI”

Unless your analyzer repo actually contains a server + frontend already, this is scope drift. If it *does* exist, fine—but they must prove it with paths.

## Paste this to the Replit Agents (Proof or it didn’t happen)

**Copy/paste exactly:**

> **STOP summarizing. Provide proof artifacts now.**
> Output the following in the next message, in this exact order, with no commentary:
>
> 1. `pwd` output
> 2. `find . -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort` output
> 3. `python analyzer_cli.py --help` output
> 4. `python analyzer_cli.py analyze --help` output (must work)
> 5. Run Test A: `python analyzer_cli.py analyze --replit` and then print:
>
>    * `ls -R out | head -200`
>    * `sed -n '1,200p' out/<LATEST_RUN_ID>/replit_profile.json`
>    * `sed -n '1,200p' out/<LATEST_RUN_ID>/target_howto.json`
>    * `sed -n '1,260p' out/<LATEST_RUN_ID>/DOSSIER.md`
> 6. Run Test B exactly:
>
>    ```bash
>    mkdir -p /tmp/miniapp
>    cat >/tmp/miniapp/README.md <<'EOF'
>    # MiniApp
>    Run:

>    EOF
>    cat >/tmp/miniapp/app.py <<'EOF'
>    print("hi")
>    EOF
>    python analyzer_cli.py analyze /tmp/miniapp
>    ```
>
>    Then print:
>
>    * `sed -n '1,200p' out/<LATEST_RUN_ID>/target_howto.json`
>    * `grep -n "python app.py" -n out/<LATEST_RUN_ID>/DOSSIER.md || true`
> 7. If you claim there is a server/frontend, print file paths proving it:
>
>    * `find . -maxdepth 4 -type f \( -name "*routes*" -o -name "server*" -o -name "app.ts" -o -name "main.ts" -o -name "package.json" \) | sort`
>
> If any command fails, show the exact error output and do not claim completion.

This forces them to show the tree, the CLI contract, the run outputs, and the how-to section. No more vibes.

## What I will check when you paste their proof back

* `analyze` is truly a subcommand and works with `--replit`
* `replit_profile.json` contains **only names** of env vars, not secret values
* `target_howto.json` steps cite **file:line** evidence
* DOSSIER has a real “How to Use the Target System” section, not generic text
* Coverage includes “dark directories” and caps were applied
* Replit mode is scanning the right root and excluding analyzer’s own folder (no self-pattern false positives)

---

## One more decision you should lock in (no debate)

**CLI contract wins.** Keep:

```bash
python analyzer_cli.py analyze --replit
```

If the agents “fixed server routes” instead of fixing the CLI, we revert that.

Paste the agent proof outputs here and I’ll give you a tight architect review + next fixes.
