You still **did not paste the raw outputs**. You pasted *another* summary that says you pasted raw outputs. That’s not workable: I can’t confirm schema fields, hashing, containment, or the completeness rubric without literally seeing the JSON and the code blocks.

So: **no ship verdict yet.** We’re stuck in the same loop.

### Here’s the only way forward

You (or the agents) must paste the raw outputs in chat. If output is long, paste it in **chunks** (A, then B, then C/D, then E, then F). No summaries between chunks.

---

## Do this now (minimal + bounded)

Run these and paste their outputs **verbatim**, in this order:

### 1) CLI help (short)

```bash
python server/analyzer/analyzer_cli.py --help
python server/analyzer/analyzer_cli.py analyze --help
```

### 2) target_howto.json (first 220 lines only)

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' /tmp/pta_out/target_howto.json
```

### 3) coverage.json (first 220 lines only)

```bash
sed -n '1,220p' /tmp/pta_out/coverage.json
```

### 4) Safety code (the exact functions only, not whole files)

If they’re in `server/analyzer/src/analyzer.py`, print just these ranges (adjust line numbers if needed):

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import re, pathlib
p=pathlib.Path("server/analyzer/src/analyzer.py")
t=p.read_text(errors="ignore").splitlines()
def dump(func):
  # naive: find "def func" and print next ~120 lines
  for i,l in enumerate(t):
    if re.match(rf"^def {func}\b|^\s+def {func}\b", l):
      start=i; end=min(i+140,len(t))
      print(f"\n### {func} (lines {start+1}-{end})")
      print("\n".join(f"{j+1:04d}: {t[j]}" for j in range(start,end)))
      return
  print(f"### {func} NOT FOUND")
for fn in ["_safe_resolve_path","_read_line_from_repo","_parse_evidence_string","_verify_single_evidence","_compute_completeness"]:
  dump(fn)
PY
```

That’s it. Once I see those four items, I can give you:

* **security confirmation** (path traversal, symlink escape, size limits, binary refusal)
* **rubric tweaks** (to prevent inflated completeness)
* **ship/no-ship** for V1 deterministic mode

---

## One immediate, concrete design correction (based on your summary)

You said:

> “Claims — Empty in --no-llm mode (correct behavior; claims require LLM).”

That’s **not acceptable** for V1 if you want this tool to be trusted. Even without LLMs, you need **deterministic claims** (low confidence is fine). Otherwise the dossier becomes a manual-only output and you lose the “what it is” half.

So V1 should have:

* deterministic claims from manifests/entrypoints/routes/scripts
* confidence capped appropriately (0.2–0.6)
* skeptic still applies

But I’ll hold detailed instructions until I see the actual JSON and code.

Paste the raw outputs (1–4). No summaries.
