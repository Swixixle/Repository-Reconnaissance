Yes — but **strategically**, not reflexively.

Right now you don’t want agents blindly rewriting every README in the repo.
You want a **controlled documentation sync pass** tied to the actual contract changes.

Let’s be precise.

# What Actually Changed

From what we verified:

* `operate.json` exists
* Gaps now include `severity`
* Dashboard replaced “How To”
* Tests enforce evidence + severity contract

So documentation must reflect:

1. The existence of `operate.json`
2. The new Dashboard UI
3. The evidence + severity model
4. The deterministic contract enforcement

Nothing else.

# What Should Be Updated

## 1️⃣ PTA README (critical)

This is mandatory.

Update:

### A) Output Files section

Add:

```
operate.json — Operator dashboard model (boot, integration, deployment, readiness, gaps). Deterministic, evidence-bound. Every actionable item is EVIDENCED, INFERRED, or UNKNOWN. Gaps include severity (high/medium/low).
```

Update description of `target_howto.json` to:

```
Legacy: evidence-scoped run steps. Prefer operate.json for operator workflows.
```

---

### B) Evidence Model section

Add:

```
Gap severity:
- high — blocks boot or core execution
- medium — impacts deployment maturity
- low — best-practice or observability improvements
```

---

### C) Deterministic mode description

Clarify:

```
--no-llm mode generates operate.json and readiness scoring without any LLM involvement.
```

This makes your product positioning much stronger.

---

## 2️⃣ Replit-specific documentation (if it references “How To”)

Search for:

```
How To
howto
target_howto
```

If it describes the old UI tab, update it to:

```
Dashboard (Operator View)
```

But do NOT rewrite the whole file.

Just patch references.

---

## 3️⃣ Root README (if PTA is referenced there)

Only update if it mentions:

* “How To tab”
* Or lacks mention of operate.json

Otherwise leave it alone.

---

# What Should NOT Be Touched

Do not:

* Rewrite marketing positioning
* Expand feature promises
* Add philosophical framing
* Update unrelated services (HALO, Lantern, etc.)

This is a stabilization pass, not a narrative expansion.

---

# How To Instruct the Replit Agent (Precise)

Give it this:

> Update PTA documentation to reflect the addition of operate.json and Dashboard tab.
> Add operate.json to Output Files section.
> Add Gap severity description (high/medium/low).
> Mark target_howto.json as legacy.
> Do not expand scope.
> Do not modify unrelated sections.
> Keep wording minimal and factual.

That prevents overreach.

# Why This Matters

Right now your system is more stable than your docs.

If someone reads the README and sees “How To tab” but the UI shows “Dashboard,” you create doubt.

Documentation must match contract.

That’s how you regain psychological control over the stack.

Now I’m going to ask you something important:

Are you feeling like you need to update everything because you’re afraid something is inconsistent — or because you actually saw inconsistencies?
