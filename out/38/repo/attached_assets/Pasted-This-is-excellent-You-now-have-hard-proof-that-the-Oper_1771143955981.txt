This is **excellent**. You now have hard proof that the “Operator Dashboard” contract is working the way it’s supposed to.

## What your outputs prove (not vibes)

### 1) The only issue is cosmetic/schema: `severity` is missing on gaps

Your gaps are:

* “No Dockerfile detected” → `status: UNKNOWN`, `evidence: []`
* “No health endpoint…” → `status: UNKNOWN`, `evidence: []`

The validator warning is correct: it expects a `severity` field. That’s a **tiny** fix.

### 2) The big win: **no fake steps**

You ran the critical invariant test:

> **EVIDENCED-without-evidence: 0**

That means the system is no longer hallucinating “how-to” steps and pretending they’re verified.

### 3) Readiness scoring is behaving sanely

* Boot: 100 (install/dev/prod/ports all inferred/evidenced)
* Integration: 100 (22 items extracted)
* Deployment: 75 with a clear blocker (“No Dockerfile detected”)
* Observability: 0 with a clear blocker (“No health endpoint … detected”)

That’s exactly the kind of “actionable truth” dashboard you wanted.

# Fix the warnings in 10 minutes: add `severity`

You have two clean choices:

## Option A (recommended): Add severity in `operate.py`

Assign deterministic severities:

* **high**: blocks deployment/run
* **medium**: impacts deploy maturity
* **low**: best-practice / nice-to-have

For your two current gaps, I’d do:

* No Dockerfile detected → **medium** (unless you require container deploy, then high)
* No observability/health endpoint → **low** (medium if you need production monitoring)

### Exact instruction to your agent

**Find in `server/analyzer/src/.../operate.py` (or similar) where gaps are appended.**
It will look like something building a list of dicts like:

```py
gaps.append({
  "rank": 1,
  "title": "...",
  "status": "UNKNOWN",
  "action": "...",
  "evidence": [],
})
```

**Add a `severity` field**:

```py
gaps.append({
  "rank": 1,
  "title": "...",
  "severity": "medium",
  "status": "UNKNOWN",
  "action": "...",
  "evidence": [],
})
```

Do for every gap.

Then re-run:

```bash
pta analyze --replit --no-llm -o ./output
```

The warnings should disappear.

## Option B: Default severity in validator

If you’d rather not touch generator yet:

* In `validate_operate(...)`:

  * if `gap.severity` missing → set `"medium"` and do not warn

This reduces strictness; Option A is better because it freezes schema.

---

# One more important thing you learned

Your boot install steps are **properly labeled INFERRED**, not EVIDENCED:

* `npm ci` inferred because `package-lock.json` exists
* `pip install -e .` inferred because `pyproject.toml` exists

That’s correct epistemic posture.

---

# Now: the big emotional takeaway

You *do* understand your stack more than you think, because you just:

* ran PTA correctly in replit/local/github modes
* interpreted validation warnings properly
* inspected JSON structure
* verified the strongest invariant (no evidenced steps without evidence)

That’s operator competence.

## Next best move

Fix `severity`, then immediately check if the **UI** is reading `operate.json` (Dashboard tab).

If you want to confirm UI wiring without guessing, run:

```bash
grep -R "operate.json" -n .
grep -R "Dashboard" -n client src server | head
```

But the quickest: tell me whether you **see the Dashboard tab** in the web UI now.
