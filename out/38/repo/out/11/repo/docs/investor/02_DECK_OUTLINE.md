# Lantern Investor Deck Outline
## 10 Slides — Payor + Legal/Compliance Lane

---

### Slide 1: Title
**Lantern: Evidentiary Record System**
- Subtitle: Defensible evidence chains for institutional risk
- Tagline: "Trace every claim to its source."

---

### Slide 2: The Problem — Compliance and Evidence Failure
- Organizations cannot prove how they reached conclusions
- AI tools produce insights but erase provenance
- Auditors, regulators, and opposing counsel demand traceability
- The gap between "findings" and "defensible evidence" is widening
- *Intent: Establish urgency and relevance to buyer's daily pain*

---

### Slide 3: The Cost of Ambiguity
- Compliance failures from missed entity connections
- Legal exposure from undocumented reasoning paths
- Audit penalties from untraceable assertions
- Reputational damage from indefensible public claims
- Quantify: average cost of audit finding, legal settlement, compliance failure
- *Intent: Make the problem financially concrete*

---

### Slide 4: Lantern System Overview
- Evidentiary record system, not an insight engine
- Four capabilities: Extract, Curate, Analyze, Report
- Local-first architecture (data never leaves user control)
- Report fingerprinting for integrity verification
- *Intent: Position as a new category, not a better version of existing tools*

---

### Slide 5: What Lantern Does — And Does Not Do
**Does:**
- Extract structured data with source offsets
- Link entities, claims, and evidence explicitly
- Gate analysis on evidence sufficiency
- Produce auditable, fingerprinted reports

**Does Not:**
- Generate conclusions without evidence
- Auto-infer relationships without explicit evidence linkage
- Replace human judgment on disputed claims
- Claim certainty where evidence is insufficient

- *Intent: Build trust through explicit limits; differentiate from "AI magic" positioning*

---

### Slide 6: Architecture and Defensibility
- Deterministic by design: configured for consistent, repeatable output
- Provenance enforcement: no offset, no item
- Hash-based stable IDs (SHA-256)
- Binary import policy: no silent field-level merging
- Report fingerprinting for post-hoc integrity verification
- *Intent: Show technical rigor that survives hostile audit*

---

### Slide 7: Example Use Cases
**Healthcare Payor:**
- Fraud investigation with auditable entity networks
- Audit defense with traceable claim evidence

**Legal/Compliance:**
- Document review with structured extraction
- Regulatory response with defensible timelines

**Institutional Governance:**
- Board reporting with cryptographic integrity
- Risk committee analysis with explicit sufficiency gates

- *Intent: Ground abstract value in concrete buyer scenarios*

---

### Slide 8: Competitive Landscape
| Category | Examples | Gap |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Doc Management | SharePoint, Box | Store, don't structure |
| AI Summarization | ChatGPT, Copilot | Insights without provenance |
| Investigation Platforms | Palantir, Relativity | Speed over defensibility |
| Manual Review | Paralegal labor | Doesn't scale, not auditable |

**Lantern:** Purpose-built for evidence traceability
- *Intent: Show whitespace in market, not direct competition*

---

### Slide 9: Business Model
- Deployment: Local-first client with optional enterprise on-premise installation
- Pricing: Per-seat licensing (analyst workstation model)
- Expansion: Add-on modules for specific verticals (payor, legal, governance)
- Services: Implementation, training, audit preparation support
- *Intent: Show clear path to revenue with enterprise-friendly model*

---

### Slide 10: Go-to-Market
**Phase 1:** Direct sales to healthcare payors and legal/compliance teams
- Pain is acute, budget exists, decision-makers are identifiable

**Phase 2:** Expand to institutional governance and AI risk functions
- Regulatory tailwinds creating new buyer category

**Phase 3:** Platform play for third-party integrations
- Evidence layer for other enterprise tools

**Why This Team:**
- [Insert team background: domain expertise, technical capability, prior exits]
- Built by practitioners who have faced this problem firsthand

- *Intent: Show credible path from first customer to category leadership*
