L1: # ELI Claim — v0.1
L2: 
L3: A claim is a structured assertion supported by external evidence.
L4: 
L5: ## Required Fields
L6: 
L7: - Statement: human-readable assertion
L8: - Evidence: links to signed artifacts (receipts, hashes)
L9: - Inference Level: proven | derived | heuristic
L10: - Scope: explicit limits of the claim
L11: - Issuer: who is making the claim (optional but explicit)
L12: 
L13: ## Non-Goals
L14: 
L15: - Claims do not self-verify
L16: - Claims are not cryptographic objects
L17: - Claims do not imply truth beyond their evidence
L18: 
L19: ELI exists to separate proof from inference.

--- FILE: EVIDENCE.md ---
L1: # ELI Evidence Contract — v0.1
L2: 
L3: ELI does not store raw evidence. ELI stores pointers to evidence and the
L4: minimum verification metadata required to check it.
L5: 
L6: ## Evidence Object (conceptual)
L7: 
L8: An evidence item MUST include:
L9: 
L10: - kind: receipt | file | url | transcript | other
L11: - locator: where to find it (path, URL, or opaque reference)
L12: - hash:
L13:   - alg: sha256 (v0.1 default)
L14:   - value: hex digest
L15: - signature (optional but supported):
L16:   - scheme: openssh-ssh-keygen-y
L17:   - namespace: halo-receipt (or other explicit namespace)
L18:   - signer_id: string (matches allowed_signers identity)
L19:   - sig_locator: where the signature file is stored
L20:   - allowed_signers_locator: where the allowed_signers file is stored
L21: - captured_at: ISO-8601 timestamp (optional but recommended)
L22: 
L23: ## Verification Expectations
L24: 
L25: - Hash verification is REQUIRED when a hash is present.
L26: - Signature verification is REQUIRED when signature fields are present.
L27: - If verification cannot be performed, the evidence item must be treated as
L28:   "unverified" and any dependent claims must downgrade inference level.
L29: 
L30: ## Non-Goals
L31: 
L32: - ELI does not define a universal truth system.
L33: - ELI does not adjudicate credibility beyond verification metadata.
L34: - ELI does not require the evidence content to be public.

L1: # ELI — Epistemic Load Index
L2: 
L3: ELI is a framework for producing justified, auditable claims from signed artifacts.
L4: 
L5: It separates:
L6: - cryptographic proof (what is provably unchanged and who signed it)
L7: - from inference (what conclusions can reasonably be drawn)
L8: 
L9: ELI is designed to work with external signing and receipt systems
L10: (e.g. HALO-RECEIPTS) rather than replacing them.
L11: 
L12: ## Quick Start
L13: 
L14: ### Run in Replit
L15: 
L16: This repository is configured to run in Replit. Simply:
L17: 1. Open this repository in Replit
L18: 2. Click "Run" to validate the ELI schema and sample output
L19: 
L20: The validation script checks that the sample ELI output conforms to the JSON schema contract.
L21: 
L22: ### Local Usage
L23: 
L24: To validate the schema locally:
L25: 
L26: ```bash
L27: node validate-schema.js
L28: ```
L29: 
L30: ## Repository Structure
L31: 
L32: - `contracts/` - JSON Schema definitions for ELI outputs
L33: - `examples/` - Sample ELI output files
L34: - `references/` - Integration documentation (e.g., HALO-RECEIPTS)
L35: 
L36: Status: early scaffold.

L9: ## Reporting a Vulnerability
L10: 
L11: **Do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.**
L12: 
L13: To report a security issue, please email: **albearpig@gmail.com**
L14: 
L15: Include:
L16: - Description of the vulnerability
L17: - Steps to reproduce
L18: - Potential impact
L19: 
L20: You should receive a response within 48 hours.
L21: 
L22: ## Scope
L23: 
L24: ELI is an early-stage framework specification. It defines schemas and contracts but does not provide production-ready implementations. No security guarantees are made for code in this repository.

--- FILE: references/halo-integration.md ---
L1: # ELI ↔ HALO Integration Boundary
L2: 
L3: ELI produces structured, schema-valid outputs that may be cryptographically
L4: receipted by HALO-RECEIPTS.
L5: 
L6: ## Contract
L7: 
L8: - ELI does NOT perform signing
L9: - ELI does NOT manage keys
L10: - ELI emits a deterministic JSON artifact
L11: - HALO derives and signs receipts against that artifact
L12: 
L13: ## Eligible for Receipt
L14: 
L15: - examples/eli-output.sample.json
L16: - Future ELI outputs that conform to:
L17:   contracts/eli-output.schema.json
L18: 
L19: ## Receipt Subject Mapping (Draft)
L20: 
L21: - subject.type: "eli-output"
L22: - subject.content_type: "application/json"
L23: - subject.byte_length: computed by HALO
