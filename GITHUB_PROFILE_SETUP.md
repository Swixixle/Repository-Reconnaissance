# GitHub Profile Setup Guide

This repository contains the content for your GitHub profile overview.

## Using PROFILE.md

The `PROFILE.md` file contains the recommended content for your GitHub profile README. To set it up:

### Option 1: Create a Profile Repository (Recommended)

1. Create a new repository named exactly `Swixixle` (matching your GitHub username)
2. Add a `README.md` file to that repository
3. Copy the content from `PROFILE.md` into that `README.md`
4. The content will automatically appear on your GitHub profile page

### Option 2: Use as Reference

Keep `PROFILE.md` in this repository as a reference document that describes the overarching philosophy connecting all your systems.

## Content Summary

The profile overview positions your GitHub presence as:

* **A coherent family of systems** — not random experiments
* **Evidence-first philosophy** — shared intellectual framework
* **Enterprise-adjacent** — serious tools for serious contexts
* **Purpose-built** — for audit, compliance, and verification needs

### Systems Covered

* **PTA (Program Totality Analyzer)** — This repository ([Demo on Replit](https://replit.com/github/Swixixle/Program-Totality-Analyzer))
* **HALO-RECEIPTS** — Cryptographic transcript verification
* **ELI Imaging** — Clinical documentation artifacts
* **Lantern** — Operational visibility systems ([Demo on Replit](https://replit.com/github/Swixixle/Lantern))

## Strategic Positioning

This content follows the "evidence over narrative, structure over noise, verification over vibes" philosophy, avoiding:

* Technical implementation details
* Internal architecture disclosure
* Revenue or adoption claims
* Competitor comparisons
* Hype or overclaiming

## Contact Information

The `CONTACT.md` file provides a template for inquiry handling that can be copied to each repository in your GitHub account.

## Word Count

The profile content is 163 words (constraint: under 350 words), leaving room for minor adjustments if needed.
