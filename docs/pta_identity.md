# What PTA Is

PTA (Proof Trust Anchor) is a tool that produces evidence-backed claims about a repository’s state, enabling reproducible due diligence and trust signals.

**Definition:**
PTA analyzes code and configuration to generate a dossier of claims, each tied to verifiable evidence.

**Problem Solved:**
PTA enables third parties to independently verify repository claims, supporting audits, compliance, and trust.

**Provides:**
- Deterministic, evidence-backed claim hashes
- Receipts index for reproducibility
- CLI for claim and dossier verification

**Does Not Provide:**
- Security certification
- Vulnerability audit
- Guarantee of correctness or safety

**Why trust this output:**
- All claims are hash-verified and reproducible
- Receipts index links every claim to evidence
- Verification CLI enables independent audit
