## PTA Contract Audit — Run 43f6636690d6

### 1. System Snapshot

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Files Analyzed | 158 |
| Files Seen (incl. skipped) | 184 |
| Files Skipped | 26 |
| Claims Extracted | 17 |
| Claims with Deterministic Evidence | 15 |
| Unknown Governance Categories | 9 |
| Verified Structural Categories | 0 |
| Partial Coverage | Yes |

### 2. Deterministic Coverage Index (DCI v1)

**Score:** 88.24%
**Formula:** `verified_claims / total_claims`

15 of 17 extracted claims contain hash-verified evidence.

This measures claim-to-evidence visibility only.
It does not measure code quality, security posture, or structural surface coverage.

### 3. Reporting Completeness Index (RCI)

**Score:** 50.08%
**Formula:** `average(claims_coverage, unknowns_coverage, howto_completeness)`

| Component | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| claims_coverage | 88.24% |
| unknowns_coverage | 0.00% |
| howto_completeness | 62.00% |

RCI is a documentation completeness metric.
It is not a security score and does not imply structural sufficiency.

### 4. Structural Visibility (DCI v2)

**Status:** not_implemented
**Formula (reserved):** `verified_structural_items / total_structural_surface`

Routes, dependencies, schemas, and enforcement extractors are not active.
Structural surface visibility is intentionally reported as null rather than estimated.
This prevents silent overstatement of governance posture.

### 5. Epistemic Posture

PTA explicitly reports:
- What is deterministically verified.
- What is unknown.
- What is not implemented.
- What requires dedicated extractors.

There is no inference-based promotion from UNKNOWN to VERIFIED.

### The project is named "rest-express" (from package.json)
Confidence: 60%
- Evidence: `package.json:2` (hash: `a1f1a980b4b8`)

### Python project named "program-totality-analyzer" (from pyproject.toml)
Confidence: 50%
- Evidence: `pyproject.toml:2` (hash: `f0d4a96fe7d6`)

## Verified Structural (deterministic extractors only)

- **dependencies**: not_implemented: requires lockfile parser (package-lock.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- **enforcement**: not_implemented: requires auth/middleware pattern detector over source files
- **routes**: not_implemented: requires AST/regex route extractor over source files
- **schemas**: not_implemented: requires migration/model file parser
