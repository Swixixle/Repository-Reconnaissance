## Inquiries

If you are evaluating tools for compliance, due diligence, or high-trust operational contexts, we welcome inquiries from:

* Risk and compliance teams assessing audit requirements
* Engineering teams inheriting or validating complex systems
* Organizations requiring verifiable documentation artifacts
* Teams operating in high-stakes environments where evidence matters

## How to Reach Us

For project-specific inquiries:

* **GitHub Issues**: Technical questions, bug reports, and feature discussions
* **GitHub Discussions**: General questions about capabilities and use cases

For private inquiries regarding:
* Compliance and audit requirements
* Enterprise deployment
* Custom integration needs
* Security and trust concerns

Please open a GitHub issue with the label `inquiry` and provide:
1. Your organization type (if applicable)
2. Brief description of your evaluation context
3. Preferred contact method

We prioritize inquiries from teams with clear operational needs over general interest.

## What We Don't Provide

* General consulting or advisory services
* Implementation of features unrelated to core evidence/verification capabilities
* Support for use cases outside compliance, audit, or operational verification contexts
* Customization for recreational or non-production environments

## Response Time

We aim to respond to legitimate inquiries within 3-5 business days. Complex questions may require additional time for thorough responses.
