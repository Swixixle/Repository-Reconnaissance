# About

We build evidence-first systems for environments where correctness, auditability, and verification matter.

Our projects focus on turning complex workflows and codebases into structured, defensible artifacts that can be reviewed, audited, and trusted — without exposing proprietary implementation details.

## Core Themes

* Deterministic analysis over probabilistic guesswork
* Explicit "known vs unknown" boundaries
* Cryptographically verifiable outputs
* Documentation that behaves like evidence

## Systems

**RR (Repository Reconnaissance)**  
Evidence-bound structural analysis for teams inheriting, auditing, or validating complex codebases.  
[Demo on Replit](https://replit.com/github/Swixixle/Repository-Reconnaissance)

**HALO-RECEIPTS**  
Cryptographically chained transcript verification for AI and workflow integrity.

**ELI Imaging**  
Audit-grade clinical documentation artifacts derived from imaging workflows.

**Lantern**  
Structured visibility systems for high-stakes operational environments.

## Philosophy

We design tools for operators, reviewers, and risk stakeholders — not dashboards for vanity metrics.

These systems are purpose-built for environments where "it seems right" is not sufficient.
